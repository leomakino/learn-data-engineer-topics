# Build Infrastructure with Terraform on Google Cloud

## Terraform Fundamentals
The set of files used to describe infrastructure in Terraform is simply known as a Terraform configuration. The format of the configuration files can be found in the Terraform Language Documentation. We recommend using JSON for creating configuration files.

The "resource" block in the instance.tf file defines a resource that exists within the infrastructure. A resource might be a physical component such as an VM instance.

The resource block has two strings before opening the block: the **resource type** and the **resource name**.

The Execution Plan describes the actions Terraform will take in order to change real infrastructure to match the configuration. The output format is similar to the diff format generated by tools like Git.

There is a + next to google_compute_instance.terraform, which means that Terraform will create this resource. Following that are the attributes that will be set. When the value displayed is <computed>, it means that the value won't be known until the resource is created.

commands:
-  create an empty file: `touch instance.tf`
