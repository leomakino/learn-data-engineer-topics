# Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure
Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure introduces important concepts and terminology for working with Google Cloud. it compares many of Google Cloud's computing and storage services, along with important resource and policy management tools.

## Introducing Google Cloud
Iaas offerings provide:
- raw compute
- storage
- network capabilities

The Google Cloud network is the largest network of its kind, and Google has invested billions of dollars over many years to build it. This network is designed to give customers the highest possible throughput and lowest possible latencies for their applications by leveraging more than 100 content caching nodes worldwide. Google Cloud’s locations underpin all of the important work we do for our customers. From redundant cloud regions to high-bandwidth connectivity via subsea cables, every aspect of our infrastructure is designed to deliver your services to your users, no matter where they are around the world.


Google Cloud’s infrastructure is based in five major geographic locations: 
- North America
- South America
- Europe
- Asia
- and Australia.

Each of these locations is divided into several different regions and zones. Regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones. A zone is an area where Google Cloud resources are deployed.

You can run resources in different regions. This is useful for bringing applications closer to users around the world, and also for protection in case there are issues with an entire region, say, due to a natural disaster.
