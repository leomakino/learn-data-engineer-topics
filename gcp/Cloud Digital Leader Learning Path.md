If you want to learn about cloud technology so you can excel in your role and help build the future of your business, then this introductory course on digital transformation is for you. 

Objectives:
- Explain why and how the cloud revolutionizes businesses
- Explain general cloud concepts
- Discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Why Cloud Technology is Transforming Business
Concerning about being ready for cloud, means to understand what its capabilities are and what it can deliver. Without that understanding, it's very hard to steer yourself into an advantageous place in the cloud world.

The most companies and certainly most individuals would not be capable of investing in and maintaining the computing capacity and data storage capacity of today's clouds.
The transformation means that companies have access to facilities they otherwise could not get access to.

It's important that the leaders at least have a conceptual grasp of what these technologies can do for their companies, their products and services to get access to cloud based technology through the Internet. Think of the Internet and the cloud as an enabling infrastructure that can be purposed in infinite different ways.

Some interesting questions about the course:
- What is cloud technology?
- What does digital transformation mean?
- How does cloud technology help you or your organization?
- Where do you even begin?

Cloud technology is transforming how organizations create value how people work, and ultimately, how people live. 

The key components of a digital transformation are:
> answer here

Google defines digital transformation as when an organization uses new digital technologies, such as public, private, and hybrid cloud platforms to create or modify business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet the needs of changing business and market dynamics. Digital transformation helps organizations change how they operate.

Understanding the scale and power of the cloud is more critical than ever before.

So what is the cloud technology, exactly?
> Essentially, instead of describing a complex web of software, servers, computers, networks, and security systems, all of that has been combined into one word: “cloud.”

The different ways organizations can implement their information technology (or IT) infrastructure are:
1. on-premises: 
1. private cloud
1. public cloud
1. hybrid cloud
1. multicloud implementations. 

### On-premises
On-premises IT infrastructure refers to hardware and software applications that are hosted on-site, located and operated within an organization's data center to serve their unique needs.
This implementation is the traditional way of managing IT infrastructure. 

The benefit of on-premises are:
- it doesn’t require third-party access
- gives owners physical control over the server hardware and software
- it doesn’t require them to pay for ongoing access.


The disavantages of on-premises are:
- To have the computing power to run their required workloads, organizations must buy physical servers and other infrastructure through procurement processes that can take months.
- It requires physical space, typically a specialized room with sufficient power and cooling. 
- Businesses (companies) need expert personnel to manage the physical servers.
- It is difficult to scale when demand spikes or business expands.
    - Organizations often acquire more computing resources than they actually need, which results in low utilization and high overhead. 
    - **Cloud computing** addresses these issues by offering computing resources as **scalable, on-demand services**. 

### Private Cloud
A private cloud is a type of cloud computing where the infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization instead of the general public. This type is also known as single-tenant or corporate cloud. 

Typically, an organization has to perform the same kind of ongoing maintenance and management for a private cloud as it would for traditional on-premises infrastructure. 

A private cloud *is hosted within an organization’s own private servers*, either at an organization’s own data center, at a third-party colocation facility

The benefit of private cloud are:
- self-service,
- scalability, 
- elasticity
- *the 3 items above with more customization available from dedicated on-premises infrastructure.*

Organizations might use private cloud if they have already made significant investments in their own infrastructure or if, for regulatory reasons, data must be kept on-premises or hosted in a certain way.

### Public cloud
The public cloud is where on-demand computing services and infrastructure are managed by a third-party provider, such as Google Cloud, and shared with multiple organizations or “tenants” through the public internet.

This sharing is why **public cloud is** known as **multi-tenant cloud** infrastructure, but each tenant’s data and applications running in the cloud are hidden from other tenants.

public cloud is equal to cloud, in these course.

The benefit of public cloud are:
- organizations don't need to acquire, configure, or manage those resources themselves
- only pay for what they use.

There are typically three types of cloud computing service models available in public cloud: 
1. infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which offers compute and storage services.
1. platform as a service (PaaS), which offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps. 
1. software as a service (SaaS), which delivers apps as services, where users get access to software on a subscription basis.

### Hybrid cloud and multi-cloud
Hybrid cloud or multi-cloud. 

In a hybrid cloud, applications run in a combination of different environments. The most common hybrid cloud example is combining a public and private cloud environment, like an on-premises data center and a public cloud computing environment.

The term **multicloud** describes architectures that combine **at least two public cloud providers**.

Although hybrid cloud and multicloud are related, they aren’t interchangeable terms. 

According to the “Flexera 2022 State of the Cloud Report,”, 89% of respondents reported having a multicloud strategy, and 80% of them take a hybrid approach by combining public and private cloud.


### The benefits of cloud computing
The main benefit of cloud computing compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure is the scalability. 

- Scalable
    - Acess to scalable resources
    - Latest technology on-demand
    - Accelerates deployment time
    - don’t need to worry about capital expenditures and limited fixed infrastructure.
- Flexible
    - Access cloud services from anywhere
    - Scale services up or down as needed to meet business requirements
- Agile
    - Organizations can develop new applications and rapidly get them into production, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
    - No infrastructure worries
- Strategic value
    - Competitive advantages: cloud providers stay updated with the latest innovations and offer them as services
    - Higher return on investment
    - Innovate and try new ideas
- Secure
    - Cloud computing security is recognized as stronger than that in enterprise data centers *because of the depth and breadth of the security mechanisms and dedicated teams that cloud providers implement.*
- Cost-effective
    - Pay for what is used
    - No overbuilding data centers capacity to handle sudden spikes in demand
    - IT staff can work on strategic initiatives

### Nintendo and Encyclopedias companies example: Why it's critical to transform and embrace new technology
The digital transformation is an **ongoing process**, not a one-time effort

It's critical that organizations **embrace new technology as an opportunity** to evolve, serve their customers better, and gain a competitive advantage. This is where cloud computing plays a significant role.

### Cloud eras
The cloud eras are:
1. Virtual Machine (VM) Era
1. Infrastructure Cloud Era
1. Transformation Cloud Era

#### VM Era
New organizations, realized that they could forgo ever buying or operating hardware and just start in the cloud.
- No need to buy or operate hardware
- Major catalyst for cloud-native companies

#### Infrastructure Cloud Era
It's when organizations migrated their IT infrastructure to the cloud
- This migration **saved costs** *because infrastructure could scale up and down more quickly and easily*
- Faster development was possible *because companies didn't need long-term infrastructure planning.*
- **Better security**
- It reduced the management load on IT staff and let organizations direct more people and resources to docus on buildsing new capabilities


The VM and cloud infrastructure eras didn't provide transformative or disruptive results, or fundamentally change how people worked outside of IT. Because:
> "Digital transformation is more than simply migrating and shifting systems to the cloud for cost saving and convenience"

Reinventing the future means changing not only where business is done, but how it is done, bring innovation to the business.

#### Transformation cloud era
This era is about spreading transformation among all teams in an organization. 

A transformation cloud is a new approach to digital transformation. It provides an environment for **app and infrastructure modernization**, **data democratization** ,**people connections** and **trusted transactions**.

It’s built on an easy-to-use platform with customized industry solutions that gives organizations the confidence that they are saving money and creating a more sustainable future for everyone.

The result is an organization that benefits from cloud computing to drive innovation, generate new revenue streams, and adapt quickly to market changes and customer needs.

### Challenges to lead to digital transformation
- Instead of asking infrastructure questions about *where* their *apps* and services *should run*, ask about **how to build** an environment that helps every thing to adapt to changing business needs.

By the way, the top drives that lead to digital transformations and their respective challenges are:
1. understanding and using data
2. best technology infrastructure.
    - *challenge: The search for a cloud platform that will serve as their foundation for growth and has the flexibility to innovate securely and adapt quickly based on market needs*
3. create the best hybrid workplace.
    - *challenge: The shift in how and where work happens requires new, stronger connections and collaboration*
4. data security
5. sustainability
    - *challenge: create a more sustainable future through products and services that minimize environmental impact*
