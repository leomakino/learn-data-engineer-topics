# Trust and Security with Google Cloud
This course explores the basics of cloud security, the value of Google Cloud's multilayered approach.

Trust and security lie at the heart of our product design and development philosophy. Security is a dynamic and ongoing process that demands constant attention and investment.

This course presents a range of security products and services that enable organizations to detect, investigate, and mitigate cyber threats while aligning with your policy, regulatory, and business objectives.

## Trust and Security in the cloud
In the field of cloud security, understanding the terminology is crucial to navigating the landscape effectively.

Concepts related to reducing the risk of **unauthorized access** to sensitive data:
1. **Privileged access**: is a security model that grants specific users access to broader set of resources than ordinary users.
1. **Least privilege**: security principle advocates granting users only the access they need to perform their job responsibilities. By providing the minimum required access, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
1. **Zero-trust architecture**: security model assumes that no user or device can be trusted by default. It also helps ensure robust security by implementing strict access controls and continuously verifying user identities.

Concepts relate to how an organization can **protect itself from cyber threats**:
1. **Security by default**:  is a principle that emphasizes integrating security measures into systems and applications from the initial stages of development. By prioritizing security throughout the entire process, organizations can establish a strong security foundation in their cloud environments.
1. **Security posture**: refers to the overall security status of a cloud environment. It indicates how well an organization is prepared to defend against cyber attacks by evaluating their security controls, policies, and practices.
1. **Cyber resilience**: refers to an organization's ability to withstand and recover quickly from cyber attacks. It involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks, responding to incidents effectively, and recovering from disruptions quickly.

Essential **security measures**:
- **firewall**: is a network device that regulates traffic based on predefined security rules. It follows certain rules to decide which traffic is allowed to enter or leave a network. These rules help keep unauthorized people or harmful things away from important cloud resources, such as servers, databases, and applications.
- **Encryption**: is the process of converting data into an unreadable format by using an encryption algorithm.
- **Decryption**: is the reverse process that uses an encryption key to restore encrypted data back to its original form.


Three essential aspects of security, components that make up a cloud security: 
1. **Confidentiality**: is about keeping important information safe and secret. 
    - It ensures that *only authorized people* can access sensitive data, no matter where it's stored or sent.
    - Encryption plays a crucial role in ensuring confidentiality in the cloud.
1. **Integrity**: means keeping data accurate and trustworthy.
    - It ensures that information doesn't get changed or corrupted, no matter where it's stored or how it's moved around.
    - a message doesn't get altered during delivery.
    - data integrity controls: checksums or digital signatures.
    - Prevents unauthorized modifications or tampering,
1. **Availability**: systems and services are accessible and ready for use by the right people when needed.

By understanding and implementing measures to address these aspects, organizations can establish a strong security framework to safeguard their digital assets.

**Control** refers to the measures and processes implemented to manage and mitigate security risks. It involves establishing policies, procedures, and technical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, and potential threats. Also, implementing robust authentication mechanisms, access restrictions, and security awareness training.


**Compliance** relates to adhering to industry regulations, legal requirements, and organizational policies. It involves ensuring that security practices and measures align with established standards and guidelines. It demonstrates an organization's commitment to data privacy and security, building trust with stakeholders, and minimizing legal and financial risks.

Cloud security involves hosting and managing data and applications in off-site data centers operated by cloud service providers. The responsibility for securing the infrastructure and underlying hardware lies with the cloud provider.

The customer is typically responsible for securing their data, applications, user access, and configurations.

Differencies between cloud security and on-premises security:
- location
- responsibility
- scalability
- maintenance and updates
- capital expenditure

Common cybersecurity threats faced by organizations:
1. **Deceptive social engineering**: phishing attacks.
1. **physical damage**
1. **malware, viruses, and ransomware**
1. **vulnerable third-party systems**
1. **configuration mishaps**: most prominent threat to cloud security.
