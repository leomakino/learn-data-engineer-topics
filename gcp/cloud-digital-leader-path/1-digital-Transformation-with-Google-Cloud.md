# Digital Transformation with Google Cloud
There's much excitement about cloud technology and digital transformation, but often many unanswered questions.

For example: What is cloud technology? What does digital transformation mean? How can cloud technology help your organization? Where do you even begin?

If you've asked yourself any of these questions, you're in the right place. This course provides an overview of the **types of opportunities and challenges** that companies often encounter in their digital transformation journey. If you want to learn about cloud technology so you can excel in your role and help build the future of your business, then this introductory course on digital transformation is for you. 

Objectives:
- Explain why and how the cloud revolutionizes businesses
- Explain general cloud concepts
- Discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Why Cloud Technology is Transforming Business
Concerning about being ready for cloud, means to understand what its capabilities are and what it can deliver. Without that understanding, it's very hard to steer yourself into an advantageous place in the cloud world.

The most companies and certainly most individuals would not be capable of investing in and maintaining the computing capacity and data storage capacity of today's clouds.
The transformation means that companies have access to facilities they otherwise could not get access to.

It's important that the leaders at least have a conceptual grasp of what these technologies can do for their companies, their products and services to get access to cloud based technology through the Internet. Think of the Internet and the cloud as an enabling infrastructure that can be purposed in infinite different ways.

Some interesting questions about the course:
- What is cloud technology?
- What does digital transformation mean?
- How does cloud technology help you or your organization?
- Where do you even begin?

Cloud technology is transforming how organizations create value how people work, and ultimately, how people live. 

The key components of a digital transformation are:
> answer here

Google defines digital transformation as when an organization uses new digital technologies, such as public, private, and hybrid cloud platforms to create or modify business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet the needs of changing business and market dynamics. Digital transformation helps organizations change how they operate.

Understanding the scale and power of the cloud is more critical than ever before.

So what is the cloud technology, exactly?
> Essentially, instead of describing a complex web of software, servers, computers, networks, and security systems, all of that has been combined into one word: “cloud.”

The different ways organizations can implement their information technology (or IT) infrastructure are:
1. on-premises: 
1. private cloud
1. public cloud
1. hybrid cloud
1. multicloud implementations. 

### On-premises
On-premises IT infrastructure refers to hardware and software applications that are hosted on-site, located and operated within an organization's data center to serve their unique needs.
This implementation is the traditional way of managing IT infrastructure. 

The benefit of on-premises are:
- it doesn’t require third-party access
- gives owners physical control over the server hardware and software
- it doesn’t require them to pay for ongoing access.


The disavantages of on-premises are:
- To have the computing power to run their required workloads, organizations must buy physical servers and other infrastructure through procurement processes that can take months.
- It requires physical space, typically a specialized room with sufficient power and cooling. 
- Businesses (companies) need expert personnel to manage the physical servers.
- It is difficult to scale when demand spikes or business expands.
    - Organizations often acquire more computing resources than they actually need, which results in low utilization and high overhead. 
    - **Cloud computing** addresses these issues by offering computing resources as **scalable, on-demand services**. 

### Private Cloud
A private cloud is a type of cloud computing where the infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization instead of the general public. This type is also known as single-tenant or corporate cloud. 

Typically, an organization has to perform the same kind of ongoing maintenance and management for a private cloud as it would for traditional on-premises infrastructure. 

A private cloud *is hosted within an organization’s own private servers*, either at an organization’s own data center, at a third-party colocation facility

The benefit of private cloud are:
- self-service,
- scalability, 
- elasticity
- *the 3 items above with more customization available from dedicated on-premises infrastructure.*

Organizations might use private cloud if they have already made significant investments in their own infrastructure or if, for regulatory reasons, data must be kept on-premises or hosted in a certain way.

### Public cloud
The public cloud is where on-demand computing services and infrastructure are managed by a third-party provider, such as Google Cloud, and shared with multiple organizations or “tenants” through the public internet.

This sharing is why **public cloud is** known as **multi-tenant cloud** infrastructure, but each tenant’s data and applications running in the cloud are hidden from other tenants.

public cloud is equal to cloud, in these course.

The benefit of public cloud are:
- organizations don't need to acquire, configure, or manage those resources themselves
- only pay for what they use.

There are typically three types of cloud computing service models available in public cloud: 
1. infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which offers compute and storage services.
1. platform as a service (PaaS), which offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps. 
1. software as a service (SaaS), which delivers apps as services, where users get access to software on a subscription basis.

### Hybrid cloud and multi-cloud
Hybrid cloud or multi-cloud. 

In a hybrid cloud, applications run in a combination of different environments. The most common hybrid cloud example is combining a public and private cloud environment, like an on-premises data center and a public cloud computing environment.

The term **multicloud** describes architectures that combine **at least two public cloud providers**.

Although hybrid cloud and multicloud are related, they aren’t interchangeable terms. 

According to the “Flexera 2022 State of the Cloud Report,”, 89% of respondents reported having a multicloud strategy, and 80% of them take a hybrid approach by combining public and private cloud.


### The benefits of cloud computing
The main benefit of cloud computing compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure is the scalability. 

- Scalable
    - Acess to scalable resources
    - Latest technology on-demand
    - Accelerates deployment time
    - don’t need to worry about capital expenditures and limited fixed infrastructure.
- Flexible
    - Access cloud services from anywhere
    - Scale services up or down as needed to meet business requirements
- Agile
    - Organizations can develop new applications and rapidly get them into production, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
    - No infrastructure worries
- Strategic value
    - Competitive advantages: cloud providers stay updated with the latest innovations and offer them as services
    - Higher return on investment
    - Innovate and try new ideas
- Secure
    - Cloud computing security is recognized as stronger than that in enterprise data centers *because of the depth and breadth of the security mechanisms and dedicated teams that cloud providers implement.*
- Cost-effective
    - Pay for what is used
    - No overbuilding data centers capacity to handle sudden spikes in demand
    - IT staff can work on strategic initiatives

### Nintendo and Encyclopedias companies example: Why it's critical to transform and embrace new technology
The digital transformation is an **ongoing process**, not a one-time effort

It's critical that organizations **embrace new technology as an opportunity** to evolve, serve their customers better, and gain a competitive advantage. This is where cloud computing plays a significant role.

### Cloud eras
The cloud eras are:
1. Virtual Machine (VM) Era
1. Infrastructure Cloud Era
1. Transformation Cloud Era

#### VM Era
New organizations, realized that they could forgo ever buying or operating hardware and just start in the cloud.
- No need to buy or operate hardware
- Major catalyst for cloud-native companies

#### Infrastructure Cloud Era
It's when organizations migrated their IT infrastructure to the cloud
- This migration **saved costs** *because infrastructure could scale up and down more quickly and easily*
- Faster development was possible *because companies didn't need long-term infrastructure planning.*
- **Better security**
- It reduced the management load on IT staff and let organizations direct more people and resources to docus on buildsing new capabilities


The VM and cloud infrastructure eras didn't provide transformative or disruptive results, or fundamentally change how people worked outside of IT. Because:
> "Digital transformation is more than simply migrating and shifting systems to the cloud for cost saving and convenience"

Reinventing the future means changing not only where business is done, but how it is done, bring innovation to the business.

#### Transformation cloud era
This era is about spreading transformation among all teams in an organization. 

A transformation cloud is a new approach to digital transformation. It provides an environment for **app and infrastructure modernization**, **data democratization** ,**people connections** and **trusted transactions**.

It’s built on an easy-to-use platform with customized industry solutions that gives organizations the confidence that they are saving money and creating a more sustainable future for everyone.

The result is an organization that benefits from cloud computing to drive innovation, generate new revenue streams, and adapt quickly to market changes and customer needs.

### Challenges to lead to digital transformation
- Instead of asking infrastructure questions about *where* their *apps* and services *should run*, ask about **how to build** an environment that helps every thing to adapt to changing business needs.

By the way, the top drives that lead to digital transformations and their respective challenges are:
1. understanding and using data
2. best technology infrastructure.
    - *challenge: The search for a cloud platform that will serve as their foundation for growth and has the flexibility to innovate securely and adapt quickly based on market needs*
3. create the best hybrid workplace.
    - *challenge: The shift in how and where work happens requires new, stronger connections and collaboration*
4. data security
5. sustainability
    - *challenge: create a more sustainable future through products and services that minimize environmental impact*

### Google's Transformation Cloud
There are five primary capabilities that form the basis of the transformation cloud:
1. Data
1. Open infrastructure
1. Collaboration
1. Trust
1. Sustainable tecnology and solutions

#### Data
Data is the key to unlocking value from AI. But becoming a data-driven company can be difficult if datasets are siloed across operational and analytical data stores. *Solution: A data cloud is a unified solution to manage data across the entire data lifecycle, regardless of whether it sits in Google Cloud or in other clouds. It lets organizations identify and process data with great scale, speed, security, and reliability.*

#### Open Infrastructure
Open infrastructure cloud brings Google Cloud services to **different physical locations**, while leaving the operation, governance, and evolution of the services to Google Cloud. It gives companies freedom to securely innovate and scale from on-premises, to edge, to cloud on an easy, transformative, and open platform. An open infrastructure embraces a partner ecosystem, instead of competing with it.

Organizations can run applications in the place that makes the most sense. An open infrastructure cloud facilitates faster innovation and reduces lock-in to a single cloud provider by giving organizations the choice and flexibility to build, migrate, and manage their applications across on-premises and multiple clouds.


1. **Open standard:** is a standard that is openly accessible and usable by anyone. Typically, anybody can participate in the development. There is no single definition, and interpretations vary with usage. Examples:
    - System: World Wide Web
    - Hardware: IEEE, ISA, PCI, AGP, USB
    - File format: HTML, XML, PNG
    - Protocols: IP, TCP, IoT, HTTP
    - Programming Languages: SQL
1. Open source refers to software whose source code is publicly accessible and free for anyone to use, modify, and share.
- Conclusion: Open source and open standards are not the same thing. Open source refers to software whose source code is freely available to users for reference, debugging, modification, and/or extension. Open standards are, typically, specifications: formal descriptions of software or software interfaces.

Google has a long history of sharing technology through open source: 
- Kubernetes
- TensorFlow
- Android
- Angular
- Apache Beam
- Bazel
- Dart
- Chromium OS
- Firebase SDK
- Flutter
- Forseti Security
- Gerrit
- Go
- Istio
- Knative

#### Collaboration
A transformation cloud isn’t just about technology. People and culture are just as important.

Hybrid work cames to stay since the COVID-19 pandemic.


This new hybrid work environment needs to support a mix of in-person and remote interactions, including immersive digital and mobile experiences.

Google offers a collaboration cloud through Google Workspace. Workspace brings together communication and collaboration apps including:
- Gmail
- Chat
- Calendar
- Drive
- Docs
- Sheets
- Meet 

#### Trust
A trusted cloud helps organizations protect what's important with advanced security tools. 

Organizations see the cloud as more secure than on-premises, and they want to make it simple so that employees, customers, and contractors can safely access their services.

#### Sustainable Foundation
According to IDC, cloud computing is estimated to save 1 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions by 2024.

At Google Cloud, for example, we partner with customers to decarbonize their digital apps and infrastructure with our sustainable technology and solutions. Google operates the cleanest cloud in the industry, with the smartest data centers that are 2 times as energy-efficient as a typical enterprise data center. 


### Google Cloud Adoption Framework
The Google Cloud Adoption framemore is more than just a model. It's also a map to real, tangible tasks that organizations need to adopt the cloud.

Moving to the cloud offers enormous benefits for transforming businesses. Yet there are also risks. The challenge is multi-dimensional, with far reaching implications for the solutions that will run in the cloud and also for the technologies that support them. The people who must implement them and the processes that govern them. 

The value of the Google Cloud adoption Framework is that it serves as a map to help organizations adopt the cloud quickly and effectively by creating a comprehensive action plan for accelerating cloud adoption.

It does this by structuring and aligning short term tactical, mid-term, strategic, and long term transformational business objectives. It provides a solid assessment of where an organization is in its cloud journey and actionable programs that get it to where it wants to be.

After cloud maturity has been assessed and actions have been recommended, it's easy to scope and structure a cloud adoption program using the framework.

### Quiz Answers
1. **Private cloud** would best suit when an organization has made significant investments in their own infrastructure and has regulatory requirements for their data to be hosted on-premises.
2. A benefit of implementing a transformation cloud that is based on open infrastructure is that *open source software reduces the chance of vendor lock-in*.
3. Two capabilities that form the basis of a transformation cloud are: 
    - Open infrastructure gives the freedom to innovate by running applications in the place that makes the most sense.
    - Data cloud provides a unified solution to manage data across the entire data lifecycle.
4. One of the benefit of the cloud to an organization that has a new application, and user subscriptions are growing faster than on-premises infrastructure can handle is that cloud is scalable, so the organization could shorten their infrastructure deployment time.
5. The definition of digital transformation is when an organization uses new digital technologies to create or modify business process, culture, and customer experiences.
6. The risks that an organization might face by not transforming as their market evolves is: Focusing on ‘how’ they operate can prevent organizations from seeing transformation opportunities.
7. A item that describes a goal of an organization seeking digital transformation is **break down data silos and generate real time insights.**
8. A limitation of on-premises infrastructure, when compared to cloud infrastructure is: The on-premises hardware procurement process can take a long time
9. GCP Cloud is a metaphor for a network of data centers

## Fundamental Cloud Concepts
It’s important to first recognize some of the fundamental cloud concepts, such as:
1. Describe the benefits of moving to cloud infrastructure through customer business use cases.
1. Explain how moving to the cloud shifts an organization's spending from capital expenditure to operational expenditure
1. How moving to the cloud affects their total cost of ownership.
1. Identify when private, hybrid, or multicloud infrastructures best apply to different business use cases. 
1. Define basic network infrastructure terminology.
1. Explain how Google Cloud supports digital transformation with global infrastructure and data centers connected by a fast, reliable network.

#### Loblaw and HSBC examples
Loblaw is Canada’s largest retailer. The Vice President of Technology at Loblaw explained: 
> ”We want our tech talent focused on creating better experiences for our customers, not maintaining infrastructure.”

Loblaw took a lift-and-shift approach (moving a copy of an existing application and data to cloud infrastructure with minimal or no redesignin) to accelerate the initial migration to Google Cloud.

They designed the cloud architecture to be easily converted to using Google Kubernetes Engine for automated deployment and scaling later.

This is an example of how the **cloud provided flexibility and improved performance** for a company. 

HSBC is one of the world’s largest banking and financial services organizations. They committed to a cloud-first strategy, in January 2021, HSBC embarked on an ambitious project to enhance and future-proof their risk management on the cloud.

> Their previous on-premises system was not capable of meeting future regulatory and business demands.

HSBC built a cloud-native risk management solution that boosts calculation speed to be ten times faster while lowering costs.

The power of a data cloud is that it has almost unlimited resources to **process large volumes of data** and reduce time to insights.

### Total Cost of Ownership
Organizations often perform a cloud Total Cost of Ownership (or TCO) analysis when they are considering moving to the cloud.

This analysis aims to weigh the cost of cloud adoption against the cost of running their current on-premises systems.

*Predicting future cots can be challenging*

A common mistake that organizations make when attempting to calculate cloud TCO is to directly compare the running costs of the cloud against their on-premises system. There costs are not equivalent.

For on-premises:
- The cost is dominated by the initial purchase of hardware and software
- Consider all the operational costs of running your own data center, such as power, cooling, maintenance, and other support services.
- Intangible costs, such as the opportunity cost of not migrating to cloud and the missed benefits, should be considered
- It is associated with assessing the cost of static resources throughout their lifetime

For cloud: 
- Cloud computing costs are based on monthly subscriptions or pay-per-use models.

### Capital expenditures (CapEx) vs operating expenses (OpEx)
There are a variety of costs and expenses which companies have to pay in order to continue running their businesses. These costs can be one-off or they can be recurring, and it can often be challenging to keep up with all of these expenses.

One way to keep track of all of them is to divide them up into different categories. The most common of which are *capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx).*

**Capital expenditures are** a company's major, **long-term expenses** while *operating expenses are a company's day-to-day expenses*. 
Examples of CapEx:
- Manufacturing plants, equipment, and machinery
- Building improvements
- Computers
- Vehicles and trucks

Examples of OpEx:
- Rent and utilities
- Wages and salaries
- Accounting and legal fees
- Overhead costs such as selling, general, and administrative expenses

Cloud differs from traditional IT in how managing costs.

With organizations moving from on-premises infrastructure to on-demand cloud services, there’s a major shift in spending from capital expenditures to operating expenses.

CapEx in on-premises:
- Buying hardware like servers, printers, or cooling systems
- Maintaining the assets above is also considered CapEx
- The more money you put toward CapEx means less free cash flow for the rest of the business.
- Data centers require a huge CapEx investment up front as organizations purchase space, equipment, and software and hire a workforce to run and maintain everything.

OpEx in Cloud:
- Costs match actual usage and are now operational expenses.
- enables organizations to pay only for what they use and only when they use it.
- Budgeting is no longer a one-time operational process completed annually.
- any employee can create resources in seconds on infrastructure owned and managed by a cloud provider.
- Cloud gives organizations the ability to start small and grow organically instead of having to guess at what is needed next week, next month, and next year.

### Private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud strategies
Let’s explore the definitions of private, hybrid, and multi-cloud, and when an organization might choose each approach.

#### Private cloud
It is when an organization has virtualized servers in its own data centers, or those of a private cloud provider, to create its own private dedicated environment.

On-premises servers are also often referred to as private clouds, but generally the distinction can be made that on-premises software runs in a local environment, whereas a private cloud is accessed through the internet.

Private cloud computing gives an organization many of the benefits of a public cloud — including self-service, scalability, and elasticity — with more customization available than from dedicated on-premises infrastructure.

Running apps on-premises Organizations may have regulated applications that must remain on-premises or mainframe systems that are difficult to move to the cloud.


#### Hybrid cloud
It is when applications are running in a combination of different environments. The most common example is combining a private and public cloud environment.

It is one of the most common infrastructure setups today because organizations can continue to use their on-premises servers while also taking advantage of public cloud. 

This approach is often used when an organization has already made significant infrastructure investments, or if, for regulatory reasons, data must be kept on-premises.

With a hybrid cloud, organizations can migrate applications to the cloud at the pace that makes sense for their business and transform their technical infrastructure over time.

Adopting a hybrid solution is an effective way for an organization to ensure compliance with regional data governance, residency, or digital sovereignty requirements.

A hybrid approach provides the freedom to innovate while still meeting 

#### Multicloud
It when there is a combination of at least two public cloud providers.

An organization might choose multicloud if they want to take advantage of the key strengths of different public cloud providers. Organizations may also operate a combination of on-premises and multiple public cloud environments, effectively being both hybrid and multicloud simultaneously. 

Running workloads in multiple clouds empowers organizations to leverage the latest innovations and capabilities from each cloud provider, thus taking a best-in-class approach to cloud features and obtaining the scale, security, and agility to innovate fast.

It also avoids vendor lock-in concerns. Improve reliability and resiliency Organizations can distribute core workloads across multiple cloud and on-premises infrastructures to reduce downtime and and concerns about over-dependence on a single source of failure. 

### How a network supports digital transformation
how does a reliable networking architecture support a digital transformation strategy? A fast, reliable, and low-latency global network ensures exceptional user experience and high performance.

Fiber-optic cables
- contain one or more optical fibers
- The fibers are used to transmit data as pulses of light over long distances.

Subsea fiber-optic cables
- carry 99% of international network traffic
- a single cable can deliver a whopping 340 Terabits per second. So, almost everyhting depends on data traffic that moves through international network infrastructure

Internet service providers (or ISPs)
- provide access to the internet to both personal and business customers, handling the traffic between the customer and the internet as a whole.
- Google has it own network of fiber-optic cables that run on both land and sea. This network connects Google's data centers and points of presence like highways connect major cities.

Internet Protocol
- It is a series of numbers that can identify a network or the location of a particular device on a network
- A domain name is an easy-to-remember name that maps directly to an IP address or set of IP addresses on the internet.
- A DNS server stores a database of domain names mapped to IP addresses that can be queried and used by computers to communicate with each other.

### Network performance: Bandwidth and latency
Bandwidth
- measure of how much data a network can transfer in a given amount of time.
- typically measured in terms of “megabits per second” (or Mbps) or “gigabits per second” (or Gbps).
- Eg The bandwidth would be the volume of water a pipe can handle flowing through per second. A wider pipe can handle more water. 

Network latency 
- It is the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another.
- It is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network.
- Often measured in milliseconds
- It’s a result of the physical distance that data must travel

### Regions and zones
Google Cloud’s infrastructure is based in five major geographic locations: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Having multiple service locations is important because choosing where to locate applications affects qualities like availability, durability, and latency, the latter of which measures the time a packet of information takes to travel from its source to its destination. 

Each of these locations is divided into several different regions and zones. 

**Regions** represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones.
- For example, London, or europe-west2, is a region that currently comprises three different zones.

A **zone** is an area where Google Cloud resources are deployed.

### Edge network
A network's edge is defined as a place where a device or an organization's network connects to the Internet.

It's called "the edge" because it's the entry point to the network. Google's Edge Network is how we connect with ISPs to get traffic to and from users.

## Cloud Computing Models and Shared Responsibility
### Cloud computing service models
Cloud computing service models:
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): offers infrastructure resources
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps
3. Software as a Service (SaaS): delivers complete applications 

”As a service” refers to the way IT resources are consumed in these models, and is a key difference between cloud computing and traditional IT.

When it's completely *on-premises*, the organizations are responsible for all of their IT infrastructure. In *cloud computing*, the cloud service provider owns, manages, and maintains the resources.

As you move up the layers from one model to another, each model requires less knowledge and management of the underlying infrastructure.
This concept is called abstraction. In cloud architecture, as the level of abstraction increases, less is known about the underlying implementation. The goal of "abstracting away” infrastructure is to reduce complexity by removing unnecessary information and simplifying operations. 

Abstraction is one of the core features of cloud computing.

### Shared responsability

The levels of **responsibility** between an organization and their cloud service provider **vary depending on which model is used**.
## Course Summary

### IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
IaaS is a computing model that offers the on-demand availability of scalable infrastructure resources, such as:
- compute, e.g.: Compute Engine;
- networking;
- storage, e.g.: Cloud Storage;
- databases.

IaaS allows organizations to lease the resources they need without having to physically maintain or manage all of it, and they only pay for what they use.



Advantages:
- One of the main reasons businesses choose IaaS is to reduce their capital expenditures and transform them into operational expenses.
- allows organizations to lease the resources they need without having to physically maintain or manage all of it, and they only pay for what they use.
- Offered as individual services.
- traditional way is challenging to scale when demand spikes or business grows. Cloud compute can scale the resources up and down rapidly rapidly according to business needs.
- It’s economical, efficient, reliable, and boosts productivity.
- flexibility to use the hardware as developers want, e.g. VM to install whatever the project needs, to achieve the solution.

Notes:
- Even being economical, unexpected cost can happen. It can be because of the intense use of the service, which are simple and easy to deploy.

what scenarios would IaaS be good for? Organizations that :
- Have unpredictable workload volumes or need to move quickly in response to business fluctuations.
- Require more infrastructure scalability and agility
- Have high business growth that outpaces infrastructure capabilities.
- Build flexible solutions that aren't possible with PaaS or SaaS.

### PaaS - Platform as a Service
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a computing model that offers a cloud-based platform for developing, running, and managing applications. 

it provides a platform for developers to develop, run, and manage their own apps without having to build and maintain the associated infrastructure.

It is possible to use built-in software components to build their applications, which reduces the amount of code they have to write. Examples: Cloud Run and BigQuery.

benefits of PaaS: 
- It reduces development time: Developers can go straight to coding instead of spending time setting up and maintaining a development environment;
- Scalable: additional capacity for building, testing, staging, and running applications whenever they need it
- It reduces management.
- it's flexible: support for different programming languages and easy collaboration for distributed teams


what scenarios would PaaS be good for?
- PaaS is suitable for organizations that: Want to create unique and custom applications without investing a lot in owning and managing infrastructure.
- Want to rapidly test and deploy applications.
- Have many legacy applications and want to reduce the cost of operations.

### SaaS - Software as a Service
Software as a service (SaaS) is a computing model that offers an entire application, managed by a cloud provider, through a web browser.

SaaS is appealing because it abstracts technology completely from the consumer;

Organizations simply pay a subscription fee for access to a ready-to-use software product.

Examples, Google Workspace: Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Meet.

It's low maintenance. It's cost-effective. It's flexible.

what scenarios would SaaS be good for?
SaaS is suitable for organizations that: Want to use standard software solutions that require minimal customization

### Choosing a cloud computing model
How does an organization decide which cloud computing model is the best option for them?
- depends on their business **needs**;
- required **functionality**;
- and available **expertise**.

**IaaS** matches with highly flexible, scalable service while maintaining control of their infrastructure; It offers the most control and customization, but also requires the most management responsibilities and technical expertise.

**PaaS** matches with building software products through a designed platform; It offers a cost-effective way to build applications but still requires some technical expertise and less management; complete control over application features.

**SaaS** matches with  features that are ready to use, without installations; It is the option with the least management responsibilities and technical expertise, but also offers the least control and customization; No control over features and functionality

Depending on the the use case, orgnizations will use **combinations of all three** to solve different business needs.

Some relevant cloud computig model variables for choosing are:
- management level, control, responsibility, flexibility, and expertise needed.

### Shared responsibility model
It is when an organization moves its infrastructure to the cloud and consequentially shifts some aspects of the responsibility to the cloud provider.

**Security** in the cloud is a **shared responsibility** between the cloud provider and the customer.

Organizations are awayes in control of securing their data, and the cloud provider is always responsible for securing the infrastructure.

Security **of the** cloud and security **in the** cloud are two **different** things: 
- Provider is responsible for the security **of the** cloud
- Customer is responsible for the security **in the** cloud

According to a Gartner report, 99% of all cloud security failures will result from user error through the year 2025.

It's possible to note where the cloud provider's responsibility ends and where the customer's responsibility begins. A general guideline is "if you configure or store it, you're responsible for securing it."

There are ratios of responsibilities between service provider and customers. In the Google Cloud the customer resposabilities follows as below:
- SaaS: Content, Access Policies. *Note: Customers still have security responsibilities, such as application usage, access policies like authentication settings to prevent phishing attacks, and the user content.*
- PaaS: Content, Access Policies, Usage, Deployment, Web app security
- IaaS: Content, Access Policies, Usage, Deployment, Web app security, Identify, Operations, Access and authentication, Network security, Gust OS, data & content.
- On-prem: Content, Access Policies, Usage, Deployment, Web app security, Identify, Operations, Access and authentication, Network security, Gust OS, data & content, Audit logging, Network, Storage + encryption, Hardned Kernel + IPC, Boot, Hardware, Physical security.

### Quiz Answers
1. IaaS is efficient, as IaaS resources are available when needed and resources aren’t wasted by overbuilding capacity.
2. Customers is always responsible for securing anything that they create within the cloud.
3. low maintenance needs matches with Software as a Service
4. PaaS offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud applications
