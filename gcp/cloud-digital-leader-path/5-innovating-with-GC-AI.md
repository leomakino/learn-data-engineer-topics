# Course Introduction
Artificial intelligence and machine learning represent an important evolution in information technologies that are quickly transforming a wide range of industries.

New tools and methodologies are needed to manage what’s being collected, analyze it for insights, and then act on those insights.

This course explores how organizations can use AI and ML to transform their business processes

## AI and ML funcdamentals
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce new content–including text, images, audio, and synthetic data. Generative AI can be used in a variety of applications, such as conversational bots, content generation, document synthesis, and product discovery.

Most data analysis and business intelligence is based on historical data, used to calculate metrics or identify trends. But to create value in your business, you need to use that data to make decisions for future business. AI and ML are the key to unlocking these capabilities.

ML provides a method to teach a computer how to solve problems by feeding it examples of the correct answers.

ML is suited to solve four common business problems:
- replacing or simplifying rule-based systems;
- automating processes;
- understanding unstructured data like images, videos, and audio;
- personalization.

Data is considered low quality if it’s not aligned to the problem or is biased in some way. If you feed an ML model low quality data, it's like teaching a child with incorrect information. An ML model can't make accurate predictions by learning from incorrect data.

To assess its quality, data is evaluated against 6 dimensions: 
- completeness: refers to whether all the required information is present; 
- uniqueness: Data should be unique; 
    - If a model is trained on a data set with a high number of duplicates, the ML model may not be able to learn accurately
- timeliness: refers to whether the data is up-to-date and reflects the current state of the phenomenon that is being modeled; 
- validity: ensures that data is in an acceptable range;
    - An example of invalid data is a date of 05-02-2024 when the standard format is defined as “YYYY/mm/dd.”
- accuracy: reflects the correctness of the data such as the correct birth date or the accurate number of units sold;
    - Whereas validity focuses on type, format and range, accuracy is focussed on form and content
- consistency: refers to whether the data is uniform and doesn’t contain any contradictory information.

Most of these problems can be solved simply by getting more high-quality data.

It’s critical that AI is used responsibly.

Google has established principles that guide Google AI applications:
- Be socially beneficial;
- Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias;
- Be built and tested for safety;
- Be accountable to people;
- Incorporate privacy design principles;
- Uphold high standards of scientific excellence;
- be made available for uses that accord with these principles.

Google will not design or deploy AI in the following application areas:
- technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm;
- weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people;
- technologies that gather or use information for surveillance;
- violating internationally accepted norms;
- technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.


Explainable AI is Google Cloud’s set of tools and frameworks to help you understand and interpret predictions made by your machine learning models. These tools are natively integrated with several Google products and services to ensure transparent AI development.
