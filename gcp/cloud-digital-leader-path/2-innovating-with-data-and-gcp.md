# Innovating with Data and Google Cloud
Traditionally, data analysis could take days or months, generally incomplete, and complex reports were often done by specialized teams, but Cloud technology can disrupt traditional data analysis.

Cloud tecnology allows data to be consumed, analyzed, and used at speed and scale never before possible.

Course summary:
- Module 1: define data and its role in digital transformation
- Module 2: Database, data warehouse and data lakes
- Module 3: Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence

## The Value of Data

Traditional IT infrastructures faces several limitations about data, like:
- Processing volumes and varieties of new data;
- finding cost effective solutions, e.g. setting up and maintaining data centers;
- scaling resource capacity up and down, e.g. regulating their capacity globally, especially during peak demand times throughout the year;
- accessing historical data;
- and deriving insights from historical and new data.

Businesses now have access to data like never before, internal information (e.g. organization digitized operations) and external information (e.g. benchmarking reports) and capturing and leveraging internal and external data is central to unlock business value (e.g. accurate insights and predict behavior to solve problems).

With Cloud technology, businesses can consume, store and process terabytes of data in real-time, and run queries instantly. Google Cloud offers:
- Economies of scale
- Automation
- Rapid elasticity
- Data access
- data centers across a global network, which creates resilience against data loss or service disruption.

A data map is a chart of all the data used in end-to-end business processes.
- User data: This category contains all data from customers who use or purchase your services and products.
- corporate data: This category includes data about the company such as sales patterns and operations. E.g. overall sales performance of each store, and store staffing structure.
- industry data: it is the data found outside of an individual organization that everyone in the sector needs to view or access to gain knowledge about a specific domain. E.g. trends, purchasing patterns, and publicly available research papers

Data can be categorized in two main types:
1. Structured: Can be easily stored and managed in databases, it's tabular data.
1. Unstructured: Non relational data. Two categories:
    1. Semi-structured: it contains fields, which don't have to be the same in every entity and are defined according of use. E.g.: JSON, ORC, Parquet
    1. Unstructured data is the data that doesn't naturally contain fields. E.g. video, audio; they are stored in a format called BLOB (Binary Large OBject).

Data is stored as objects (blobs) in the data lake. An object consists of the data itself, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique identifier.

With the right cloud tools, businesses can extract value from unstructured data by using APIs to create structure.

APIs are a set of functions that integrate different platforms, with different types of data.

Any conversation about data needs to include a reference to security, privacy, compliance, and ethics.

Personal or sensitive data about a customer or an employee need to be securely collected, encrypted when stored in the cloud, and protected from external threats. Further, only a subset of users should be granted permission to view or access the private data.

Regional or industry-specific regulations often guide data policies. GCP offers a range of solutions and best practice resources that companies can leverage.

Ethical and fair considerations are important when working with AI and machine learning.

Human bias can influence the way datasets are collected, combined and used. It's important to include strategies to remove unconsicious biases when leveraging data to build business value

Quiz Answer:
1. It is required to operate efficiently at all the time. The alternative that corroborate with this requirement is "Evaluate real-time data to predict maintenance requirements"
1.  For traditional enterprises, the key benefits of using cloud technology to unlock value from data are: process terabytes of data in real-time; query data and retrieve results instantly
1. Learner demographics, their purchases, and browsing history can be stored in the corporate data
1. Education and Years of experience are appropriate and relavant data to improve recruitment efficiency using machine learning.
1. Images and videos are example of unstrustured data.
