# Understanding Google Cloud Security and Operations
The course examines cost management, security, and operations in the cloud. First, it explores how businesses can choose to maintain some or none of their own infrastructure by purchasing IT services from a cloud provider. Next, it explains how the responsibility of data security is shared between the cloud provider and the business, and explores the defense-in-depth security built into Google Cloud. Finally, it covers how IT teams and business leaders need to rethink IT resource management in the cloud and how Google Cloud resource monitoring tools can help them to maintain control and visibility over their cloud environment.

Embracing cloud effectively requires a change in mindset in business operations. One important change is how tech and non-tech-adjacent teams operate.

## Financial Governance in the cloud
Leveraging cloud technology either for business improvements or for large-scale transformation doesn't come without some challenges. One of the common pain points many organizations face regardless of which cloud provider they use is managing cloud costs.

This includes anything from **planning and budgeting** for cloud resources to being able to **monitor and control** monthly spend to optimizing it as needed to accurately **forecasting** future costs.

Yesterday's solutions (Excel) for predicting and controlling costs don't work well in the cloud era.

Cloud technology can provide organizations with the means to make more dynamic decisions and accelerate innovation, but managing cloud costs requires vigilance and real-time monitoring in parallel.

Anyone can now access cloud resources on demand, managing IT infrastructure costs no longer sits mainly with the finance team. Instead, it involves more people across multiple teams.

Whatever your role, understanding how using cloud technology affects your business from a cost perspective will help you maximize the business value your organization gains from using the cloud.

### Fundamentals of cloud cost management
Operational expenditures (Opex) in practice with cloud, budgeting is no longer a one-time operational process completed anually. Infrastructure procurement has radically changed. Given the right permissions, almost any employee can spend up resources in seconds. Therefore, cloud resources must be monitored and controlled on an ongoing basis.

The ease of access to cloud resources brings it the need for more precise, real time control of what is being consumed.

Unpredictable costs, lack of visibility, and transparency into the cloud usage are among the top pain points when managing cloud enviroments.

Businesses usually waste over their estimates. They are underestimating their cloud financial waste.

Keeping costs within budget and limiting surprises were among the most critical cost management tasks.

The solution through three lenses:
- People
    - partnership accross finance, technology, and business functions is required. This partnership would consist of several experts who ensure that best practices are in place across the organization and there is visibility into the ongoing cloud spend.
- Process
    - What could resources are being used and by whom? 
    - What are the associated resource costs?
    - How do these costs measure against the broader business strategy?
- Technology - GCP brings its own native tools to help organizations monitor and manage their costs. The tools enable organizations to:
    - gain greater **visibility**;
    - drive a culture of **accountability** for cloud spending,
    - **control** costs to reduce the risk of overspending.
    - provide **intelligent** recommendations to optimize costs and usage.


It'll need a core team across technology, finance, and business functions to work together to make decisions in real time.

Through this close collaboration, they'll be able to control and optimize cloud costs on an ongoing basis.

### Total cost of ownership - TCO
In IT, the Total Cost of Ownership refers to a comprehensive assessment of all of the layers within the infrastructure. This includes:
1. user expenses, and the cost of service downtime.
1. communications
1. management and support
1. hardware and software

Historically, companies spent a substantial amount of money upfront to set up their IT infrastructure, the **capital expenditure** (capex) **would include**:
- paying for data center space and associated costs, such as power and cooling;
- storage systems,
- networking,
- hardware,
- software,
- security systems.
The TCO in this case would be the cost of setting up , managing, controlling, and optimizing every layer of the stack. In addition to the personnel required and skilled workers.

When organizations run their business using public cloud services, much of their capital expenditure no longer applies.

When organizations choose to keep some of their business running on-premises and some running on public cloud, the total cost of owneership for them would be more complex. TCO can vary depending on an organization's cloud adoptions goals.

Cloud, is not just about assessing cost savings. There are values the company gain over time, e.g.: cloud absorbs the effort that organizations traditionally put into hosting their applications or data on-premises, allowing the company to shift focus from maintaining status quo to higher value work. Examples of indirect values are: efficiency, reliability, and security.

Google Cloud provides tools to help monitor and control costs and maximize value. 

### Best practices for managing Google Cloud costs
1. Organizations need to identify the individual or team that manage costs. 
    - If it's a team, it should ideally be a mix of IT team managers and financial controlles
1. Learn the difference between invoices and cost tools.
    - Understand what kind information can be found in an invoice versus cost management tools.
    - An invoice and a Google Cloud tool are not the same thing
1. Use cost management tools for accountability
    - gain visibility, control, and intelligence.

An invoice contains how much the company is spending over a period of time.
Cost management tools are more effective for answering the why of the spendings.
    - It helps get more granular data, find trends, and identify actions.

Before organizations can optimize their cloud costs. They first need to understand:
1. what they're currently spending;
1. whether there are any trends;
1. what their forecasted costs are.

An organization needs to start capturing:
- what Cloud resources are being used, 
- by whom, 
- for what purpose, 
- and at what costs.

The organization also needs to think about:
- who is going to be responsible for monitoring this,
- who needs to be involved in managing costs, 
- how they will communicate the results or report on spending on an ongoing basis.

It's important to review the business priorities and establishing partnership between financial and IT teams, perhaps through a centralized team. Also, it's important to set up the cadence and format for ongoing communication with key cloud stakeholders.

The centralized team can use Google Cloud built-in reporting tools and create custom dashboards to gain greater visibility into their costs. The team should review these reports at least weekly.

Cloud spending is decentralized and variable. It's important to establish a culture of accountability for costs across the organization. Google Cloud offers flexible options to organize resources and allocate costs to individual departments and teams.

Defining clear ownership for projects and sharing cost views with the departments and teams that are using Cloud resources will help us establish this accountability culture and more responsible spending. This team should use these tools to regularly identify and report on cost inefficiencies.

In addition to making teams accountable for their spending, Google Cloud financial governance policies and permissions make it easy to control who has the ability to spend and view costs across your organization.

Creating budgets and alerts to notify key stakeholders when spending is getting off track, it is an important practice to keep costs under control.

Finally, organizations can make smart spending decisions with **intelligent** recommendations delivered by Google Cloud. It helps to:
- optimize usage,
- save time on management,
- minimize costs. 

An organization can see these recommendations which can easily be applied for immediate cost savings and greater efficiency.

### Quizz
1. Google Cloud's tools offer four key benefits for managing cloud costs: Visibility, accountability, control, intelligent recommendations.
1. Budgeting needs to be assessed on a daily, monthly, or weekly basis when a company starts using a service-based cloud architecture.
1. Creating a custom dashboard would give her and her teammates greater visibility into costs.
1. The primary factores that contribute to the complexity of calculating the TCO when migrating to the cloud are:
    - Cloud architecture
    - Qualified personnel
1. Sharing cost views with the departments that are exceeding their IT budgets promotes a culture of accountability.
