# Understanding Google Cloud Security and Operations
The course examines cost management, security, and operations in the cloud. First, it explores how businesses can choose to maintain some or none of their own infrastructure by purchasing IT services from a cloud provider. Next, it explains how the responsibility of data security is shared between the cloud provider and the business, and explores the defense-in-depth security built into Google Cloud. Finally, it covers how IT teams and business leaders need to rethink IT resource management in the cloud and how Google Cloud resource monitoring tools can help them to maintain control and visibility over their cloud environment.

Embracing cloud effectively requires a change in mindset in business operations. One important change is how tech and non-tech-adjacent teams operate.

## Financial Governance in the cloud
Leveraging cloud technology either for business improvements or for large-scale transformation doesn't come without some challenges. One of the common pain points many organizations face regardless of which cloud provider they use is managing cloud costs.

This includes anything from **planning and budgeting** for cloud resources to being able to **monitor and control** monthly spend to optimizing it as needed to accurately **forecasting** future costs.

Yesterday's solutions (Excel) for predicting and controlling costs don't work well in the cloud era.

Cloud technology can provide organizations with the means to make more dynamic decisions and accelerate innovation, but managing cloud costs requires vigilance and real-time monitoring in parallel.

Anyone can now access cloud resources on demand, managing IT infrastructure costs no longer sits mainly with the finance team. Instead, it involves more people across multiple teams.

Whatever your role, understanding how using cloud technology affects your business from a cost perspective will help you maximize the business value your organization gains from using the cloud.

### Fundamentals of cloud cost management
Operational expenditures (Opex) in practice with cloud, budgeting is no longer a one-time operational process completed anually. Infrastructure procurement has radically changed. Given the right permissions, almost any employee can spend up resources in seconds. Therefore, cloud resources must be monitored and controlled on an ongoing basis.

The ease of access to cloud resources brings it the need for more precise, real time control of what is being consumed.

Unpredictable costs, lack of visibility, and transparency into the cloud usage are among the top pain points when managing cloud enviroments.

Businesses usually waste over their estimates. They are underestimating their cloud financial waste.

Keeping costs within budget and limiting surprises were among the most critical cost management tasks.

The solution through three lenses:
- People
- Process
- Technology

It'll need a core team across technology, finance, and business functions to work together to make decisions in real time.

Through this close collaboration, they'll be able to control and optimize cloud costs on an ongoing basis.
