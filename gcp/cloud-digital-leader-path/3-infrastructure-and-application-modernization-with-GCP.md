# Infrastructure and Application Modernization with Google Cloud
Many traditional enterprises use legacy systems and applications that often struggle to achieve the scale and speed needed. IT decision makers constantly have to choose between maintenance of legacy systems and investing in innovative new products and services.

This course explores the challenges of an outdated IT infrastructure and how businesses can modernize it using cloud technology. It begins by exploring the different compute options available in the cloud and the benefits of each, before turning to application modernization and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

## Infrastructure with GCP
Consumer expectations over the last 20 years have radically changed. Customers now expect connected digital experiences in real time.

Many businesses, especially large enterprises, built their IT infrastructure on premises.

Legacy systems and applications make up the organization's IT backbone. Also, these legacy systems and applications struggle to achieve the scale and speed needed.

In this course, we'll explore the challenges of an outdated IT infrastructure and how businesses can modernize that infrastructure using cloud. Examine compute options available in the cloud and the benefits of each.

The module two, will focus on application modernization. Cloud technology enables businesses to develop, deploy and update applications with speed, security and agility built in.

It will cover App Engine, a GCP solution that lets application developers build scalable web and mobile applications on a fully managed serveless platform.

Thw module three presents APIs and explain how they unlock value from legacy systems, enable businesses to create new value, and monetize new services.

It will also cover Apache, a GCP for developing and managing APIs.

Remember, it's not necessary to be an IT specialist to create new business value or to develop innovative services. By understanding how infrastructure, applications, and APIs work together, you can initiate conversations about new projects and be more knowledgeable about strategic planning for digital transformation.
