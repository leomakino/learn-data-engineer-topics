## SDLC - Software Development life cycle

It's important because:
- It provides a standardized framework that defines activities and deliverables
- It aids in project planning, estimating, and scheduling
- It makes project tracking and control easier
- It increases the speed of development
- It decreases project management expenses and the overall cost of production

SDLC phases
- Planning phase: it includes resource allocation, capacity planning, project scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning.
- Coding phase: system design in an integrated development environment. It also includes static code analysis and code review for multiple types of devices.
- Building Phase: takes the code requirements determined earlier and uses those to begin actually building the software.
- Testing Phase: entails the evaluation of the created software. entail the performance of functional testing: unit testing, code quality testing, integration testing, system testing, security testing, performance testing and acceptance testing, as well as nonfunctional testing. 
- Release Phase: involves the team packaging, managing and deploying releases across different environments.
- Deploy Phase:  the software is officially released into the production environment.
- Operate Phase: entails the use of the software in the production environment.
- Monitor Phase: various elements of the software are monitored.

## SDLC models/methodologies
- Waterfall: the oldest, simplest, and most structured methodology. Each phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase, and all phases run sequentially.
- Agile: produces ongoing release cycles, each featuring small, incremental changes from the previous release.
- Lean: inspired by lean manufacturing practices and principles. The lean principles encourage creating better flow in work processes and developing a continuous improvement culture. 
- Iterative: each development cycle produces an incomplete but deployable version of the software. 
- Spiral: the development process is driven by the unique risk patterns of a project
- V-Shaped: verification phases and validation phases are run in parallel.

## Prototyping Model
It is one of the most popularly used Software Development Life Cycle Models (SDLC models). This model is used when the customers do not know the exact project requirements beforehand. In this model, a prototype of the end product is first developed, tested, and refined as per customer feedback repeatedly till a final acceptable prototype is achieved which forms the basis for developing the final product. 

## SOLID
The SOLID ideas are:
- The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
- The Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
- The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use"
- The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

Although the SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development.

## Test-driven development (TDD)
It is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. 

TDD cycle:
1. Add a test
1. Run all tests. 
1. The new test should fail for expected reasons
1. Write the simplest code that passes the new test
1. All tests should now pass
1. Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure that functionality is preserved.
    - Code is refactored for readability and maintainability.

## Behavior-driven development (BDD)
It is a software development process that goes well with agile software development process that encourages **collaboration among developers**, quality assurance experts, and customer representatives in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.

Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.

## Unified Modeling Language
It is a general-purpose visual modeling language that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

## DEVSECOPS
is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.

DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. 

## Web service
A web service (WS) is:
- a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the Internet
- a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images)
