# Course Description
From text summarization, explaining complex concepts, drafting engaging marketing content, and generating and explaining code, you'll learn about the most common applications of ChatGPT. youâ€™ll be equipped with a framework to evaluate new use cases and determine if ChatGPT is the right solution for your needs. Finally, you'll explore the legal and ethical considerations that come with implementing ChatGPT in various situations.

# Interacting with ChatGPT
Learn how to interact with ChatGPT effectively to produce high-quality content. In this chapter, you'll learn about ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations, and how to write prompts that maximize the quality of the generated content. 

Difference between standard chatbots and chatGPT:
- Standard Chatbots
    - They are usually designed to return a **predetermined response** to a **limited number of questions**
- ChatGPT
    - It is far **more generalizable**, as it uses its understanding of language to **interpret the question** or task and determine the most appropriate response


ChatGPT is an example of a generative AI model. A model creates new content based on patterns in information it has already seen.


From prompt to response:
1. User writes a question or instruction, which is more generally called *prompt*
2. LMM interprets the prompt
    1. This prompt is passed as an input to a large language model, or LLM. 
    1. LMM use complex algoithms to determine patterns and structure in language.
3. These patterns are then used to interpret the prompt and **generate new, relevant language in response to it**.
4. Response is returned to the user

Summarizing text
- Chat GPT is great at summarizing text and explaining concepts
- Save time when summarizing reports
- Interpret complex information more easily. It has the ability to remember the conversation history and reduce the sentence.
- E.g.:
    - Summarize GDPR in simple terms
    - Please reduce the summary to two sentences

Creating Marketing content
ChatGPT is already being applied to streamline many different marketing tasks, including:
- creating e-mail templates, writing blog post titles and descriptions, and copyediting large bodies of text.
- E.g.:
    - Write a tweet encouraging people to acquire data literacy skills

**Generating and debugging code**
- Chat GPT is also impacting how software engineers, data practitioners, and others write code.
- ChatGPT is able  to generate template code, explain why code isn't working and even make suggestions for improvements
- E.g.:
    - Write Python code to load an Excel spreadsheet

Why utilize ChatGPT?
- ChatGPT is able to perform many time-consuming tasks with greater efficiency
- Using our own expertise, we can then verify and finalize the responses
- AI doing the legwork and a human providing the finishing touches saves a substantial amount of time and money
- Greater personalization

## Limitations of ChatGPT
Although ChatGPT is valuable tool that can perform a huge variety of tasks, there are some limitations to be aware of the use it effectively.

1. ChatGPT was trained on data up to a certain data and the model isn't connected to the internet or other external sources, so it isn't aware of events beyonf this date.
2. Training data bias: the potential bias in the training data.
    - It was trained on a massive text dataset from a variaty of sources including books, articles and websites but this data could contain biases.
    - The model may learn these biases and produce biased responses.
3. Context tracking: ChatGPT has the ability to build on information and context from earlier in the conversation, so follow-up corrections can be made.
    - If the content of the conversation shift multiple times, it can keep track of the context and generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses.
    - A good rule is to keep a conversation to one topic and create new conversations for different topics
4. Hallucination: which is when the model confidently tells us inaccurate information.
    - This often occurs when attempting to go beyond ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff or abilities.
    - E.g.: "Provide a summary of this Linkedin profile: link here"
    - Instead of telling us that it isn't able to open URLs. ChatGPT confidently provides a summary of entirely false information.
5. Legal and ethical considerations
    - Example: Create a song in the style of and existing band.
        - It will generate a song that resembles the style of this artist based on the song lyrics that were present in the training data, but who owns this new song?
    - It's easy to fall into one of these legal gray areas if the use casesChatGPT aren't properly scoped.

## What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT, by OpenAI, is a **conversational language model**, which means it can **answer questions** or perform tasks that **yield a text-based response**.

# Adopting ChatGPT
Due to the wide range of potential applications of ChatGPT and its ease of use, one of its major challenges is deciding when to use it. In this chapter, you'll learn about common use cases of ChatGPT to begin streamlining your own workflows. You'll understand how to evaluate a use case as a suitable application and consider the legal and ethical implications. Finally, you'll learn about the key factors that will decide the future of generative AI models like ChatGPT.
