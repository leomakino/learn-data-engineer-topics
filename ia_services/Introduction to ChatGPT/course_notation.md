# Interacting with ChatGPT
Learn how to interact with ChatGPT effectively to produce high-quality content. In this chapter, you'll learn about ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations, and how to write prompts that maximize the quality of the generated content. 

## What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT, by OpenAI, is a **conversational language model**, which means it can **answer questions** or perform tasks that **yield a text-based response**.

Difference between standard chatbots and chatGPT:
- Standard Chatbots
    - They are usually designed to return a **predetermined response** to a **limited number of questions**
- ChatGPT
    - It is far **more generalizable**, as it uses its understanding of language to **interpret the question** or task and determine the most appropriate response


ChatGPT is an example of a generative AI model. A model creates new content based on patterns in information it has already seen.


From prompt to response:
1. User writes a question or instruction, which is more generally called *prompt*
2. LMM interprets the prompt
    1. This prompt is passed as an input to a large language model, or LLM. 
    1. LMM use complex algoithms to determine patterns and structure in language.
3. These patterns are then used to interpret the prompt and **generate new, relevant language in response to it**.
4. Response is returned to the user

Summarizing text
- Chat GPT is great at summarizing text and explaining concepts
- Save time when summarizing reports
- Interpret complex information more easily. It has the ability to remember the conversation history and reduce the sentence.
- E.g.:
    - Summarize GDPR in simple terms
    - Please reduce the summary to two sentences

Creating Marketing content
ChatGPT is already being applied to streamline many different marketing tasks, including:
- creating e-mail templates, writing blog post titles and descriptions, and copyediting large bodies of text.
- E.g.:
    - Write a tweet encouraging people to acquire data literacy skills

**Generating and debugging code**
- Chat GPT is also impacting how software engineers, data practitioners, and others write code.
- ChatGPT is able  to generate template code, explain why code isn't working and even make suggestions for improvements
- E.g.:
    - Write Python code to load an Excel spreadsheet

Why utilize ChatGPT?
- ChatGPT is able to perform many time-consuming tasks with greater efficiency
- Using our own expertise, we can then verify and finalize the responses
- AI doing the legwork and a human providing the finishing touches saves a substantial amount of time and money
- Greater personalization

## Limitations of ChatGPT
Although ChatGPT is valuable tool that can perform a huge variety of tasks, there are some limitations to be aware of the use it effectively.

1. ChatGPT was trained on data up to a certain data and the model isn't connected to the internet or other external sources, so it isn't aware of events beyonf this date.
2. Training data bias: the potential bias in the training data.
    - It was trained on a massive text dataset from a variaty of sources including books, articles and websites but this data could contain biases.
    - The model may learn these biases and produce biased responses.
3. Context tracking: ChatGPT has the ability to build on information and context from earlier in the conversation, so follow-up corrections can be made.
    - If the content of the conversation shift multiple times, it can keep track of the context and generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses.
    - A good rule is to keep a conversation to one topic and create new conversations for different topics
4. Hallucination: which is when the model confidently tells us inaccurate information.
    - This often occurs when attempting to go beyond ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff or abilities.
    - E.g.: "Provide a summary of this Linkedin profile: link here"
    - Instead of telling us that it isn't able to open URLs. ChatGPT confidently provides a summary of entirely false information.
5. Legal and ethical considerations
    - Example: Create a song in the style of and existing band.
        - It will generate a song that resembles the style of this artist based on the song lyrics that were present in the training data, but who owns this new song?
    - It's easy to fall into one of these legal gray areas if the use casesChatGPT aren't properly scoped.

## Writing effective prompts
Prompts are the one piece of the ChatGPT interaction that the user has control over, and because of this, writing effective prompts has become a field in its own right—prompt engineering.


Garbage in, garbage out:
- If the prompt we provide doesn't contain sufficient context or isn't written in an easily-interpretable way, chances are it will lower the quality of the response.

How does ChatGPT interpret a prompt? E.g.: Please write a job description for a data engineer based in Florianópolis
1. Identify the topic
    - First, ChatGPT identifies the broad topic of the prompt
    - In this case, the phrases job description, data engineer and Florianópolis help the model identify that the prompt is about a job description for a specific role and location.
2. Understand the prompt
    - It attempts to understand what the prompt is requiring
    - In this example, the verb write and job description indicate the task **being** given to ChatGPT
    - Data engineer and Florianópolis provide **additional context** to help populate the response with *relevant information*.
3. The response is generated
*Obs:More content could be added to the prompt for greater personalization, such as key role-specific skills and company culture information*

How to talk the language of AI: Prompt engineering
- Prompt engineering is the process of writing prompts to maximize the quality and relevance of the response
- It is the foundational best practices to get the most out of our ChatGPT prompts

Writing tips for prompt engineering
- Be clear and specific
- Include all of the necessary context to create the desired response
    - E.g.: In a summarizing task, specify the desired length
- Keep prompts concise
    - short and clear, expressing what needs to be said without unnecessary words
    - Extra words will only dilute the important information and keywords
- Use correct grammar and spelling
    - ChatGPT uses grammar to interpret the task, so make sure to include it in all the right places
- Provide examples if necessary
    - It can be a much quicker way of providing context
    - E.g.: Please write a list of example names, ages and cities. For example: Leonardo Makino, 29 (Data Engineer)



# Adopting ChatGPT
Due to the wide range of potential applications of ChatGPT and its ease of use, one of its major challenges is deciding when to use it. In this chapter, you'll learn about common use cases of ChatGPT to begin streamlining your own workflows. You'll understand how to evaluate a use case as a suitable application and consider the legal and ethical implications. Finally, you'll learn about the key factors that will decide the future of generative AI models like ChatGPT. 

## Enabling people to use ChatGPT
In this chapter, we'll focus on when to use ChatGPT and how to scale its adoption safely and responsibly.

Augmenting workflows
- **Workflows:** Standardized series of tasks to achieve an end goal
- Workflows (Goals) contain some time-consuming and repetitive tasks, but many of these can now be performed by ChatGPT


All industries and roles can benefit from integrating ChatGPT into their workflows.
- **Leaders:** Compose emails, draft presentations, brainstorm strategic ideas, and summarize meeting notes.
- **Technical roles (roles that spend a lot of their time writing code)**: The typical workflow often includes repetitive taks like looking up code syntax and writing documentation
    - Use cases: Recall code syntax and generate examples, explain code, troubleshoot errors and even write documentation to accompany the code.
- **HR and people teams:** brainstorm initiatives for improving employee engagement and well-being
- **Marketing:** Write social media posts, help with copyediting human-written content, and creating all types of text-based marketing copy.


## Identifying use cases for ChatGPT
Deciding when it's appropriate to use ChatGPT isn't easy and requires considering ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations.

1. The first question to ask ourselves is if we require a high degree of accuracy in the response. If the task: **Require accurate results**?
    - Because it can be inaccurate
    - and there's no predictability in this response (two people providing the same prompt often get different responses)
2. Can the response qualify be verified?
    - This is where subject matter expertise still plays a huge part in the workflow
    - A good rule of thumb is to **not ask** ChatGPT **to do something that we couldn't do** ourselves given enough time
3. The use case may require inputting sensitive data?
    - Need consent to process the data
    - Must adhere to data governance laws, such as LGPD
    - Legal counsel may be able to enable the use case
4. Require ownership of content?
    - OpenAI's terms of use claim ownershio over ChatGPT output in many cases
        - Other considerations such as copyright infringement may prevent ownership

## Ownership and privacy
- Ownership and privacy are key considerations when scoping ChatGPT's suitability for a particular use case.
- Neglecting to consider there factors, especially for companies, can bring with it financial penalties, lawsuits, and damage to customer trust and brand image.
- Establishing ownership over the response is crucial, mainly if we intend on integrating ChatGPT into revenue-generating products.

Who owns the response?
- Assuming compliance, users can claim ownership over the response
- We can not claim ownership over responses that are considered non-unique, as they can also be generated for other users.
- Factual questions or generating small text cannot claim ownership
- We can't claim that responses from ChatGPT were human-generated.
- For products or tools built on top of ChatGPT, we'll need to ensure that customers aren't under the misapprehension that the generated content is human-generated.
- ChatGPT can't be used to infringe on a person's rights, which includes copyright infringement
- **OpenAI update their terms of use regularly, so be sure to double-check them before giving the green light**

Prompt privacy
- ChatGPT is being continuously developed and improved
- OpenAI may use prompts and responses for performance improvements
- If we're interacting with ChatGPT via the webpage and don't want this data being used for performance improvements, we'll need to contact OpenAI to opt out of this usage agreement.
- Inputting sensitive data without the proper consent could risk breaching data governance laws.
- **ChatGPT must not only satisfy OpenAI's terms of use but must also adhere to the applicable data governance laws**

Data ethics
- Data echics is a field dedicated to ensuring that data is used with people and society's best interests in mind.
- So, ask whether the use will negatively or positively impact people.

## Advancements in generative AI
What's to come in generative AI? What challenges need to be overcomer?
- Performance improvements
- More human-like content
- Handle more complexity
- deep understanding of language, including complex language expressions, such as sarcasm and idioms

Building balanced datasets
- Challenge: ensuring data is high quality and balanced
- Reducing bias before training model is difficult
- Goal: Develop more robust bias mitigation procedures

AI for everyone
- Accessibility is key to ChatGPT's success
- One crucial requirement to continue the adoption of generative AI is ensuring the democratization of AI tools so everyone has access to the benefits of this amazing technology
