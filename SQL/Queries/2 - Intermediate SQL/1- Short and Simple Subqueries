\--WHERE are the subqueries
Subquery in Where can only return a single column

What is a subquery?
A: A query nested inside another query
	an additional SELECT statement contained inside parentheses, surrounded by another complete SQL statement
Useful for intermediary transformation (selecting filtering or calculating inf.)
Can be placed in any part of the query
	SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and GROUP BY
	Where you place it depends on what you want your final data to look like
Can (subquery) return a variety of information
	Scalar quantities (3.14159, -2, 0.0001)
	A list (id=(12, 25, 392, 401, 939))
	A table (What I use most)
Can be evaluated independently from the outer query

Why might I need to use a subquery?
	To compare groups to summarized values
	To Reshape data for multiple purposes
	To combine data that cannot be joined (from tables where you are unable to join)
	To filtering list with IN
	

\--Subqueries in FROM
 A subquery in FROM is an effective way of answering detailed questions that requires filtering or transforming data before including it in your final results.
Useful when calculating aggregates of aggregate information

Returns a set of more complex results
Restructure and transform data
	Transforming data from long to wide before selecting
	Prefiltering data

You can create multiple subqueries in one FROM statement
You can join a subquery to any existing table

\--Subqueries in SELECT
used in a SELECT statement to bring summary values into a detailed data set

Returns a single, aggregate value
Used in mathematical calculations

Make sure you have all filters in the right places
	Properly filter both the main and the subquery
	Since the subquery is processed before the main query, you'll need to include relevant filter in the subquery as well as the main query

\-- Subqueries every where
As many subqueries as you want

Best practices for reading, and writing large queries:
	Format your queries
	Annotate your queries with comments
	Indent your queries

Is that subquery necessary?
	Subqueries require computing power
