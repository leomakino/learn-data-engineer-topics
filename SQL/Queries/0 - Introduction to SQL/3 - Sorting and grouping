\-- ORDER BY
ORDER BY - keyword is used to sort results in ascending or descending order according to the values of one or more columns. 
By default ORDER BY will sort in ascending order(1,2,3,4, or A-Z).

	SELECT name
	FROM people
	ORDER BY name;

Sorting multiple columns:
	SELECT release_year, duration, title
	FROM films
	ORDER BY release_year, duration;
Here, It will query ordered by release year; If a release year is equal, it will distinguish by the duration to decide which will come first.	
	
\--GROUP BY
GROUP BY allows you to group a result by one or more columns.
Commonly, GROUP BY is used with aggregate functions like COUNT() or MAX().
GROUP BY is for performing operations within groups.
*SQL will return an error if you try to SELECT a field that is not in your GROUP BY clause without using it to calculate some kind of value about the entire group.

	SELECT sex, count(*)
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY sex
	ORDER BY count DESC;
	
HAVING it's like a WHERE clause used to filter based on the result of an aggregate function (GROUP BY).

	SELECT release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
	FROM films
	WHERE release_year > 1990
	GROUP BY release_year
	HAVING AVG(budget) > 60000000
	ORDER BY avg_gross DESC;
