\--Course Description
This course will provide you an understanding of how to use built-in PostgreSQL functions in your SQL queries to manipulate different types of data including strings, character, numeric and date/time. We'll travel back to a time where Blockbuster video stores were on every corner and if you wanted to watch a movie, you actually had to leave your house to rent a DVD! You'll also get an introduction into the robust full-text search capabilities which provides a powerful tool for indexing and matching keywords in a PostgreSQL document. And finally, you'll learn how to extend these features by using PostgreSQL extensions.

Parsing and Manipulating Text
Learn how to manipulate string and text data by transforming case, parsing and truncating text and extracting substrings from larger strings.

\--Reformatting string and character data
Concatenation
	|| - The string concatenation operator
	CONCAT(str_1, str_2, ...) - function to concatenate
Letter Case Functions - Changing the cae of string
	UPPER(string) - Transform the string to upper case
	LOWER(string) - Transform the string to lower case
	INITCAP(string) - Transform the string to title case

REPLACE(source, old_text, new_text)
	finds a substring in a string and replace it with a different substring
REVERSE(string)
	Return reversed string.
	
first_name || ' ' || last_name || ' <' || email || '>'

\--Parsing string and character data
LENGTH(string) or CHAR_LENGTH(string)
	Return the number of characters in a string
Position(string) OR STRPOS
	Finds the position of a characer in a string
	E.g.: POSTION(‘B’ in ‘A B C’)

Parsing string data
	LEFT(string, n) - Return the first n character in a string
	RIGHT(string, n)) - Return last n characters in the string. When n is negative, return all but first |n| characters.
	SUBSTRING ( string ,start_position , length )  
		returns a part of string
		It can be combined with other functions to provide additional capabilities

\--Truncating and padding string data
Removing whitespace from strings
TRIM([leading | trailing | both] [characters] from string)
	Removes the longest string that contains a specific character from a string
	By default, the TRIM() function remove spaces (‘ ‘)
	LEADING - remove spaces from the beginning of a string
	TRAILING - Removes spaces from the end of a string
	BOTH - Removes all spaces at the beginning and ending of a string
	
	LTRIM() removes all characters, spaces by default from the beginning of a string
	RTRIM() removes all characters, spaces by default from the end of a string
	LPAD - Pad on the left a string with character to a certain lengh
