\--Course Description
This course will provide you an understanding of how to use built-in PostgreSQL functions in your SQL queries to manipulate different types of data including strings, character, numeric and date/time. We'll travel back to a time where Blockbuster video stores were on every corner and if you wanted to watch a movie, you actually had to leave your house to rent a DVD! You'll also get an introduction into the robust full-text search capabilities which provides a powerful tool for indexing and matching keywords in a PostgreSQL document. And finally, you'll learn how to extend these features by using PostgreSQL extensions.

Working with Data and Time Functions and Operations
Explore how to manipulate and query date and time objects including how to use the current timestamp in your queries, extract subfields from existing date and time fields and what to expect when you perform date and time arithmetic.

\--Overview of basic arithmetic operators
In this chapter you will learn functions and operators to manipulate date and time data
CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NOW()
	Retrieve the current date and time
AGE()
	It calculates the difference between two timestamps
	Returns an interval as a result
EXTRACT(), DATE_PART(), DATE_TRUNC()
	Manipulate timestamps to retrieve subfields of date and time values

Adding and subtracting date / time data
	SELECT date '2005-09-11' - date '2005-09-10';
		It returns an integer data type
	SELECT date '2005-09-11' + integer '3';
		It returns a date data type
	SELECT date '2005-09-11 00:00:00' - date '2005-09-09 12:00:00';
		It returns an inverval as the result

Calculating time periods with AGE
	SELECT AGE(timestamp '2005-09-11 00:00:00', timestamp '2005-09-09 12:00:00');

Date / time arithmetic using INTERVALs
	It is a great technique to complete relative date and time calcultions.
	SELECT rental_date + INTERVAL '3 days' as expected_return
	FROM rental;
	SELECT timestamp '2019-05-01' + 21 * INTERVAL '1 day';
	SELECT INTERVAL '1' day * timestamp '2019-04-10 12:34:56'

\--Functions for retrieving current date/time
now()
	It's a built-in function to get the current date and time.
	returns the current timestamp. Ex: 2022-10-22T17:58:19.772Z
now()::date
	use the double colons (::) to cast a DATETIME value to a DATE value
	returns the current timestamp: Ex: 2022-10-22
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(precision)
	now and current_timestamp are equivalent.
	The precision specifies the number of digits in the fractional seconds precision in the second field of the result
CURRENT_DATE
	returns the current date
CURRENT_TIME(precision)
	returns the current time with time zone
	The precision argument specifies the returned fractional seconds precision. If you omit the precision argument, the result will include the full available precision.
	
\--Extracting and transforming date / time data
Extracting and transforming date and time data
	Often need to extract parts of timestamps
	Or convert/truncate timestamp precision

EXTRACT(field FROM source)
	retrieves a field from a date/time value
	The field argument specifies which field to extract from the date/time value
	The source is a value of type TIMESTAMP or INTERVAL
DATE_PART(field,source)
	EXTRACT and DATE_PART are equivalent
	Retrieve subfields from a date/time value
date_trunc('datepart', field)
	truncates timestamp or interval data types
	The datepart argument is the level of precision used to truncate the field
