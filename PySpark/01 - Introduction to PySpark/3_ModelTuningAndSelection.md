## Model tuning and selection

What is logistic regression?
- is very similar to a linear regression
- instead of predicting a numeric variable, it predicts - the probability of an event

Hyperparameter:
- is a value in the model that's not estimated from the data, but rather is supplied by the user to maximize performance.
- to optimize your model.
	
Cross validation: 
- k-fold cross validation is a method of estimating the model's performance on unseen data
- is a good estimate of the actual error on the held out data
