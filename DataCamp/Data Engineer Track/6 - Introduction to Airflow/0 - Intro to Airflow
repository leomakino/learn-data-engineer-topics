\--Introduction to Airflow
What is a workflow?
	A set of steps to accomplish a given data engineering task
	E.g. Download data->clean data->run ML pipeline->upload results to webserver->generate report
	
What is Airflow?
	Airflow is a platform to program workflows, including:
		Creation
		Scheduling
		Monitoring
	It can implement programs from any language, but workflows are written in Python
	Implements workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
	Accessed via code, command-line, or via web interface
	Other workflow tools:
		Luigi
		SSIS
		Bash scripting

Airflow implements workflows as Directed Acyclic Graph (DAGs):
	Represents the set of tasks that make up the workflow
	Consists of the tasks and dependecies between tasks
	Created with various details about the DAG
		name
		start date
		owner, etc.


\--Airflow DAGs
Directed
	There is an inherent flow representing dependencies between components
	provide context to the tools on how to order the running of components
Acyclic
	It does not loop/cycle/repeat
Graph
	Represents of components and the relationships between them

DAGs
	Are written in Python(but can use components written in other languages)
	Are made up of components (typically tasks) to be executed
		operators
		sensors, etc.
	Contain dependencies defined explicitly or implicitly
	
Command line vs Python
	Use Command line tool to:
		Start Airflow processes
		Manually run DAGs/Tasks
		Get logging information from Airflow
	Use Python to:
		Create a DAG
		Edit the individual properties of a DAG
