Numbering rows: Number the rows
	SELECT
	  *,
	  -- Assign numbers to each row
	  ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS Row_N
	FROM Summer_Medals
	ORDER BY Row_N ASC;

ORDER BY: If you want to assign 1 to the last row

SELECT
	  Year,
	  -- Assign the lowest numbers to the most recent years
	  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Year DESC) AS Row_N
	FROM (
	  SELECT DISTINCT Year
	  FROM Summer_Medals
	) AS Years
	ORDER BY Year;

PARTITION BY splits the table into partitions based on a column's unique values
 if you have multiple events, genders, or other metrics as columns, you'll need to split your table into partitions

Partition by likes divides the rows by categories and apply sql statements rules for each category such as:
	ROW NUMBER will reset for each partition
	LAG will only fetch a row's previous value if its previous row is in the same partition
