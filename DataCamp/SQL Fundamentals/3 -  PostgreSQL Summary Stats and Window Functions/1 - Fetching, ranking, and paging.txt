Fetch: 
	(GET): to go get something or someone and bring the thing or person back
Rank: 
	(Position): A particular position, higher or lower than others
Pag:
	(Computer): The text of an electronic document that can see on a computer screen
Chunk: a thick, solid piece of something
	
	

\--Fetching functions
Relative Functions - the value they fetch is always relative to the current row
	LAG(column, n) returns column's values at the row n before the current row (desloca para baixo)
	LEAD(column, n) returns column's value at the row n rows after the current row (desloca para cima)
		useful to compare a current value to a future value
Absolute Functions
	FIRST_VALUE(column) returns the first value in the table or partition
	LAST_VALUE(column) returns the last value in the table or partition

By default, a window starts at the beginning of the table or partition and ends at the current row
RANGE BETWEEN... clause extends the window to the end of the table or partition

RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND   f UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
It's is the same as RANGE BETWEEN the first line until the last line

\--Ranking functions
ROW_NUMBER() always assigns unique numbers, even if two rows' values are the same
RANK() assigns the same number to rows with identical values, skipping over the next numbers in such cases
DENSE_RANK() also assigns the same number to rows with identical values, but doesn't skip over the next numbers

ROW_NUMBER and RANK will have the same last rank, the count of rows
DENSE_RANK's last rank is the count of unique values being ranked

\--Paging
Paging is splitting data into (approximately) equal chunks

Uses
	Many APIs return data in "pages" to reduce data being sent
	Separating data into quartiles or thirds (top middle 33%, and bottom thirds) to judge performance

NTILE 
	splits the data into n approximately equal pages
	allows you to make the size of the dataset you're working with more manageable

NTILE (3) OVER () AS Third to paging and labeling the top, middle and bottom of the data

Splitting your data into thirds or quartiles is often useful to understand how the values in your dataset are spread.
Getting summary statistics (averages, sums, standard deviations, etc.) of the top, middle, and bottom thirds can help you determine what distribution your values follow.
