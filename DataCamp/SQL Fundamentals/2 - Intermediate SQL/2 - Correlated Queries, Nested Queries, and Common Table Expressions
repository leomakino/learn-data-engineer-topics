\--Correlated subqueries
Correlated subqueries are subqueries that reference one or more columns in the main query. 

Uses values from the outer query to generate a result
Re0run for every row generated in the final data set
Are used for special types of calculations: advanced joining, filtering, and evaluating data


\--Nested subqueries


\--Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Common Table Expressions is a solution for reading complex query.
It improves readability and accessibility of information in subqueries
It is a special type of subquery that is declared ahead of your main query

Why use CTEs?
	Executed once
		CTE is then stored in memory
		Improves query performance
	Improving organization of queries

\--Deciding on techniques to use
JOINs: 
	allow you to directly combine information from 2 or more tables, and on their own;
	They are mostly limited to simple combinations and aggegations of tables already present in your database;
Correlated Subqueries:
	Allows you to combine information between a subquery and a table, or another subquery;
	Helps simplify your syntax and circumbent the limits of a join
	High processing time
Multiple/Nested Subqueries:
	Useful when your data requires multi-step transformations before it's in the form you need for your final query;
	Improve accuracy and reproducibility
Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
	Allow you to organize your subqueries sequentially by declaring them at the beginning of your query;
