SQL dialects:
- additional proprietary extensions to handle the specifics of that database management system.
- extensions to provide functionality not covered by the SQL standard.
	
Some popular dialects of SQL: 
- Transact-SQL (T-SQL). This version of SQL is used by Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.
- pgSQL. This is the dialect, with extensions implemented in PostgreSQL.
- PL/SQL. This is the dialect used by Oracle. PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language/SQL.

		to manipulate the rows in a relational table, e.g. Retrieve (query) data, insert new rows, or edit existing rows.
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
