# Explore the jog roles in the world of data
What are the roles in the world of data? A: Database Administrators, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts.

1. Database Administrators
They manage databases, assigning permissions to users, storing backup copies of data and restore data in case of any failures. An Azure database administrator is responsible for the design, implementation, maintenance, and operational aspects of on-premises{in a server, pc} and cloud-based database solutions built on Azure data services and SQL Server.

2. Data Engineers
They are vital in working with data, applying data cleaning routines, identifying business rules, and turning data into useful information. It includes data ingestion pipelines, cleaning and transformation activities, and data stores for analytical workloads. They're also responsible for ensuring that the privacy of data is maintained within the cloud and spanning{to exist or continue for a particular length of time} from on-premises {is a method of deploying software. With on-prem, the computer programs are installed right on the user’s computer} to the cloud data stores.

3. Data Analysts
They explore and analyze data to create visualizations and charts to enable organizations to make informed decisions. They also enable advanced analytics capabilities through reports and visualizations to deliver relevant insights.

# Review tasks and tools for database administration
A database administrator's primary job is to ensure that data is available, protected from loss, corruption, or theft, and is easily accessible as needed.
His responsabilities involves taks surround the data base. It's like the data engineering responsabilities is until the data base. The administrator focus in the data inside the database and the analyst for analysis.

# Review tasks and tools for data engineering
Data engineers are tasked with managing and organizing data, while also monitoring for trends or inconsistencies that will impact business goals. It’s a highly technical position, requiring experience and skills in areas like programming, mathematics, and computer science. But data engineers also need soft skills to communicate data trends to others in the organization and to help the business make use of the data it collects.

Some tasks:
- Aligning the data architecture with business requirements.
- Using programming languages and tools to examine the data.
- Identifying ways to improve data reliability, efficiency, and quality.

- Using data to discover tasks that can be automated.
- Deploying{to put something to use} sophisticated analytics programs, machine learning, and statistical methods.


Tools: 
- SQL Server Management Studio - data manipulation tool might be Transact-SQL.
- Azure Databricks and Azure HDInsight - to generate and test predictive models. 
- Azure Cosmos DB - to store in the non-relational field.
- HiveQL, R, or Python - To manipulate and query the data.

# Review tasks and tools for data visualization and reporting
Data analysts are responsible for understanding what data actually means. A large part of the data analyst role is concerned with communication and visualization. Data visualization is key to presenting large amounts of information in ways that are universally understandable or easy to interpret and spot patterns, trends, and correlations.

Tools: 
- Microsoft Excel - to create rich visual reports (Traditional)
- Microsoft Power BI - o create rich, graphical dashboards and reports over data that can vary dynamically (Sophisticated)
- SQL Server Reporting Services
